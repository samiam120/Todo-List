In this project, I developed a dynamic To-Do List app that helped me strengthen several key skills:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP): Used classes and factory functions to manage to-do items as objects.

Modular Design: Separated application logic from DOM manipulation by organizing the app into distinct modules.

Local Storage: Implemented localStorage to persist tasks and projects across page reloads.

External Libraries: Integrated date-fns to efficiently handle date formatting and manipulation.

CRUD Operations: Implemented full functionality for creating, updating, and deleting tasks.

Error Handling: Ensured smooth app behavior by managing potential issues with missing data in localStorage.
